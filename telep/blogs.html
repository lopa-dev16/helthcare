             <h2>Life goes on</h2>
             <p>Life hit rock bottom for every single member of my family the day my mum took her own life.

                On 28 July 2018, my brother was diagnosed with delusion disorder. Since then, I had a hunch that my mother might one day take the path that she did. Nevertheless, I tried to brush this thought off as I believed that with my love and support, she would be able to accept and overcome the challenges of coping with my brother’s condition.
                
                It is hard to imagine when looking back how I got by the last few months. On hearing the news that day, it felt like I had a brain concussion – the shock, the disbelief, the pain! It was a traumatic experience having to identify her and sign the death certificate. Nothing made sense. She had been just lying next to me the night before, after I had given her a massage, and within hours, she was gone forever! A cold corpse lying in the mortuary for me to kiss her goodbye for the last time.
                
                It was agonising to see my frail dad heartbroken, and crying his heart out like I had never seen before. Even though I was devastated, I held back my tears in front of my dad to avoid upsetting him further and ignored my feelings to ensure the funeral arrangements were attended to. It was the last thing I could do for my mum – for us to bid our final farewell to her.
                
                If you think things must be difficult during the wake, I can tell you that it was even harder after the funeral. I had suddenly become the head of the household overnight, the pillar for everyone in the family to lean on and the one responsible for ensuring the family was well despite the tragedy. My immediate priority after the incident was the welfare of my dad and brother. My dad is getting on in age. As an ex-stroke patient, I was afraid the blow would be too much for him to take. He could neither sleep nor eat well ever since. He even refused to take his regular medication. I had to step in as I could not allow him to undergo any further mishap or stress that aggravates his health.
                
                I was also worried about my brother’s condition, which seemed to have worsened with my mum’s sudden death. He became very distanced and quiet. His refusal to seek treatment to-date did not help to alleviate our stress levels. Relations were constantly strained at home as we experienced changes and adjusted to new family dynamics. It was hard to communicate with my brother when everyone’s emotions were running high. Our ignorance about his condition brought the tension to the next level.
                
                As I write, it has been almost six months since my mum’s passing. My heart stops whenever I recall the dreadful day. What I have learnt in that time is the importance of support. I would still be living like a zombie, completely dazed, if I had not been open to seeking help and speaking to others as part of my healing process. I realised that I could not handle everything by myself, and that my family needed a lot of support during this difficult period. In order to hold my family together, I reached out to as many resources as I could to tide us through.
                
                Although what I experienced was tremendously painful to deal with, I now accept that life goes on. Everyone has their own challenges to deal with in life. What matters most is how we cope with it, and the attitude we adopt to overcome our hurdles. My family has never regretted not being there for my mum as we constantly spent quality time with her. My mum will always be with us as we continue to hold on to the values she instilled in us. Her early departure just created an opportunity for us to build stronger bonds with my dad now. Being a traditional man, our relationship with dad had always been distanced as displays of open affection were just not my dad’s cup of tea. Since my mum’s demise, dad had made a huge effort to change himself and our relationship with him now is stronger than before. This makes caring for my brother a lot easier when the family is on the same line.
                
                Living in a society like Singapore, with our lifestyle getting more and more stressful, we should be proactive in taking care of our mental health. I recently heard that 1 in 7 Singaporeans will suffer from mental health issues. I wish that I had prior knowledge of mental health and the impact it has on people, so that I could have gotten early treatment for my brother and mum, and avoided this tragedy. My brother is at present finally seeking treatment, and I was surprised when the doctor shared he had been living with his condition for the past four years. I often wonder why I had not noticed it earlier. On the other hand, I am relieved that he is getting professional care now and I just need to be more patient on his road to recovery. Now that the family is aware of his condition and united in supporting him, I believe we are stronger and more resilient in the face of mental health obstacles.
                
                I want to encourage everyone to ask for help when necessary. In our Asian society, we care so much about face that sometimes we would rather suffer in silence than seek help. When it comes to crises like this involving my loved ones, I have learnt to become shameless. I do not care what others think about my situation. All I know is that I simply cannot risk losing a family member again. It is important to ditch the “losing face” mentality. Ditch the thoughts about how others might view you! Ditch the stigma around mental health conditions! Get proper support for yourself.
                
                As much as I love my family, I have also learnt to love myself more. As caregivers, self-care is important. You can only take good care of your loved ones when you are well. Weeks after my mum’s passing, I proceeded with a planned vacation as I needed to get away and recharge. I also made the decision to take a career break to focus on rebuilding myself first. I would not have had the courage to do so, especially in our society, without the support of my loving dad and sisters. It is important to realise what really matters in life, and I have come to be more positive by appreciating something good taking place each day. Simple things that can make my day are: a meal cooked by my dad, a colleague buying me a cup of kopi, receiving a sweet message to cheer me up, or even not having to wait very long for the bus. After all, we only live once, and I just feel fortunate to have this opportunity.
                
                It is good that the government is beginning to recognise the role caregivers play in the society these days. I hope that more can be done to fight against mental health stigma – for instance, I would like to see workplaces refrain from questioning applicants whether they have had past mental conditions during the selection process. This causes discrimination and stops people from seeking help.</p>

               <h2>I Lost My Brother to Suicide</h2>
               <h3>-By Sanaya Chokshey</h3>
               <p>A highly-accomplished, intelligent and much-loved man has been in the news for the last 48 hours. He sat himself down in a car with the heater on and the windows rolled up. The tributes pouring in stop there and don't venture to say the obvious. 

                The consensus in my family is that there is no point in stating the obvious. Out of respect for a lifetime of achievements, there is no need to say how he died or why he died the way he did. 
                
                A week ago, another respected businessman jumped off a bridge into a river. In his case, there was no such hesitation. The obvious was stated in headlines around the country.
                
                Why are the two events perceived so differently? The second gentleman had well-known business troubles, he left behind a note and thus, a verdict of suicide was inevitable. That verdict will haunt his life story forever.
                
                A human being who takes his own life seems to threaten all living beings. Suicide points out that life is finite, life is not a gift from a questionable God, nor are we beholden to live it to its natural conclusion. Suicide is a full stop, a question mark, an exclamation point.
                
                Why does suicide have the power to affect those left behind so viscerally?
                
                Shame. In some deep corner of our psyche, suicide is intertwined with a sense of inadequacy. We feel ashamed of and for the person who has killed himself. Weak. Scared. Quitter. These are the words that rattle around in our brains. Or are we, the living, ashamed that we couldn't stop one of our own stepping into the unknown? A decision is taken that is beyond the control of society, family and government.
                
                Guilt. Sometimes I think not so much because we didn't stop the suicide but instead — and this is far more difficult to comprehend — guilt because we too want a way out. Modern life is full of real and imagined duties and responsibilities. The pressure of these imagined burdens might tempt us all, at one time or another, to want to give it all up and find a cave in the mountains or a spot under a shady tree. 
                
                Losing My Brother
                I spent most of my life convinced that there was nothing worse a family could experience than the suicide of one of its own. 
                
                My brother was seven years three months older than me. It was a typical sibling relationship, lots of squabbling, bullying, whining, etc. He was 21 years and 10 months old when he killed himself. There was a huge sense of relief that the tension had finally reached a conclusion. He had tried to kill himself three, maybe four times in the preceding year. There would be no more frantic calls to doctors late at night or early in the morning, no more days of tiptoeing around while he recovered from the latest attempt. The stress of anticipating the next time (and there was never any doubt that there would be a next time, not in my head at least) had been tremendous, and now it was gone.
                
                The hurt and sense of betrayal, the shock and delayed grief, the anger, these coloured my world. I wanted answers to unanswerable questions: why did he kill himself? Were we not enough? Was life that unbearable? 
                
                When people learnt that he had died by suicide, the reaction from some was a sense of titillation — eager to hear the gory details but still happy that it didn't happen to them. Some friends stood by me like a rock and still do. 
                
                For years, I had kept quiet about my brother's death because my family made it clear that it was not a topic they wanted to discuss with me. I think it was far more difficult for my parents and my oldest brother to acknowledge their failure as adults to help him, though now they claim they never hid it from anyone. Perhaps they spoke about it adult to adult but I was never a part of the conversation. So I had my own conversations in my head and with a couple of friends. 
                
                It was only my mother's death three years ago that set me free to write about suicide. When I finally broke my silence, I was overwhelmed with the flood of messages of love and support from people who had known him and loved him.
                
                My family continued to not speak of his suicide until a few months ago this year, when I wrote a memoir, which my father and oldest brother are not happy about. Even so, the conversation hasn't been an honest one. Everyone claims to have done their best to help him. They claim that as a teenager, I was too young to know what was going on or to grieve. Wrong on both counts.
                
                It took me many years to accept his decision. The grief never goes away. But I've learnt to live with it. I see things differently because of this filter. I judge people and situations differently too. I did therapy for a couple of years and laid to rest some questions of obsession and paranoia. But it's a process. I acknowledge that I am an addict to grief and each day I have to work at overcoming this addiction.
                
                Acceptance of his choice to end his suffering has been too long coming. I do know one truth now that I didn't in the aftermath of my brother's death. It's that death is death. Questioning the reasons, running alternate scenarios, railing against the fates: pointless, futile, exercises in uselessness.
                
                Things are different now from 37 years ago and then again not. People talked in whispers and the conversation died when you entered the room. It still happens on occasion. I think people resent me talking openly and lovingly of his death. I think they expect me to be ashamed. Why would I be? He is my brother. 
                
                To others who have lost someone to suicide: don’t rush the process of grieving. Ignore everyone who says get over it or it's been so long, time to move on. Your grief is your own. You wear it the way it fits you. It gets better but it also comes back and lashes you when you least expect it to. All you can do is accept it and grow with it. 
                
                Talk to other people who get it. Support groups help. Therapy helps. I wish my brother had had access to either 37 years ago. He didn't. Learn to use the resources available. Don't be afraid to ask for help. 
                
                I wish I had been able to understand and accept it many years earlier. I think I do now. The anger, the hurt has receded. What is left, finally, is some measure of peace. My brother fought his demons for many years. I love him, I respect his life and his death and I will never again belittle either by denial or silence.</p>

                <h2>Somedays,I think about suicides</h2>
                <h3>-By Oyuang Soyeng</h3>
                <p>My story has nothing to do with physically attempting it, but rather stopping myself from following through suicide ideation.

                    Suicide ideation, also known as suicidal thoughts, refers to the process of thinking of planning to carry out suicide. It is not to be mistaken as attempted suicide, where the person follows through the plan.
                    
                    During moments of dread, anxiety, depression and the myriad of negative emotions on a daily, constant basis, whenever it peaks, suicide ideation also peaks.
                    
                    Suicide ideation isn’t something I’m proud to share, but speaking about it and coming to terms that it’s part of me, and has been with me since the trauma that caused it, does help me prepare for when it comes about.
                    
                    My own experience stems from abandonment, physical and mental suffering through National Service. Having gone through a sudden break-up, and within months going through National Service, the toil on both my body and mind caused me to have frequent breakdowns. I was seen by a psychiatrist who told me that if I was lying about my condition, I would be thrown into Detention Barracks (army prison), which left me feeling threatened and traumatised. 
                    
                    I was 48kg heavy, 177cm tall when I entered the army for training. One would expect me to not be physically capable of keeping up with the rest when it comes to physical training, but the system is relentless. This persisted for about a year or so with less and less support from the people and organisations around me. This was when where suicide ideation began for me.
                    
                    Medication that reduces the aforementioned sufferings also robs me of any sense of purpose and fulfilment in going about daily routines of my life, and so through talks with my former psychiatrist, my prescription was removed.
                    
                    Everybody can imagine and empathise with the pain a person goes through when they encounter physical trauma, while nobody cares to realise that mental, emotional and psychological suffering also exists.
                    
                    People who suffer from mental, emotional and/or psychological trauma, and end up having suicidal ideation, tend to have suffered constantly for a prolonged period of time.
                    
                    As such suffering can’t be determined through data and numbers, or physical anomalies, many people dismiss it when sufferers confide in their loved ones.
                    
                    Oftentimes, these moments tend to be brushed off, and I have had many moments of being ostracised, ridiculed for my weak mental state, and selfishly berated for choosing the ‘easy way out’. It is no different from kicking someone when they are down and out, and reinforces the idea that there isn’t anybody who is truly there to understand, or even try to. No proper, consistent support was given during those moments.
                    
                    People can understand brief moments of grief, loss, and pain; yet can’t tolerate when others are not able to pick themselves back up as quickly or as well as most. Even mental healthcare workers can easily get carried away with intolerances on their part when sufferers go to them for help. I know that from personal experience. Empty words do nothing to help, especially when action does not follow through.
                    
                    Strong logic has been the boon and bane of my life. On one hand, it has helped me in many problem-solving situations, developing empathy towards others, and changing my perspectives of others who lead different lives from me. On another hand, this logic also reinforces the negative effects of trauma, society on the whole letting me down, and not having real support. If I cannot heal from my suffering, what better way than to remove myself from suffering any further by suicide, I frequently wonder.
                    
                    Suicide ideation has been a part of my life, and will always be until a constant and consistent structure of love and support is present. Every waking moment has a rough percentage tacked onto it. On good days, it feels 10%; on most days, it’s 20-30%. On rough days, it hits 70-80%. In moments that trigger mental breakdowns, it hits 110-140%.
                    
                    During such moments, I have to stop myself from moving in order to not proceed with stopping the pain permanently. This usually involves a lot of quiet crying, curling up like a ball for hours at end, and constant shaking. The aftereffects of these breakdowns persist for days at end, up to 3 weeks.
                    
                    Hobbies and interests take up most of my coping mechanisms. This resulted in rotating multiple hobbies – I dabble in video games, watching anime, building PCs, read up on technology on the whole, practice martial arts, learn street latin dances, build model kits, among others. These hobbies reduce my interaction with other people, or they provide some physical connection to substitute the love and support I need. And having this many hobbies takes away my desire for suicide.
                    
                    Having been single since the trauma that triggered it, and a really brief long distance relationship that ended up being cheated upon, I can only rely on luck to guide me to the love and support I need to gradually heal.</p>
